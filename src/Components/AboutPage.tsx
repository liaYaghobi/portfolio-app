          Based in Los Angeles, I'm a full stack developer whose coding journey started in computer science classes. 
          While I have a knack for full stack development, what keeps me hooked is the thrill of learning. 
          Every project is an adventure, and I love the collaborative dance of codingâ€”it's about turning ideas 
          into reality and making friends along the way. When I'm not coding, you can find me tending to my plants, 
          enjoying the outdoors (I love to hike, yes I know, crazy), and relishing the company of friends and family.
